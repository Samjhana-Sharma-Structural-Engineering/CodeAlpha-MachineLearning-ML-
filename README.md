In this repository, I will upload the source code of machine learning projects that I completed during my CodeAlpha internship.
**Projects Overview**
1.	**Disease Prediction From Medical Data**
In this project, a machine learning model was used to predict heart diseases based on the medical data. By utilizing various relevant health metrics, it assist in early diagnosis and provides recommendations, for effective healthcare solutions.


•	**Disease_Detection.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
• **heart**: Folder containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
